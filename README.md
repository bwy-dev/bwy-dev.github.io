BWY-Dev Blog using Jekyll
=========================

This is a blog I am maintaining to keep track of my latest projects, as well as random useful bits of information that I learn during my studies.

This website uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) the [Xixia theme](https://github.com/zxixia/jekyll-xixia).
