## Welcome!

Welcome to my blog, my name is Ben Wordsworth Yates and I am a computing student currently studying an access course and hoping to start university next year. I have an interest in game development in Unity, and I am currently trying to write a game every week (to mixed success). I mostly use C# and python, but am also in the process of making a larger more robust blog and portfolio using Ruby on Rails. I decided to create a blog to store thoughts, comments and things I've learned over the space of my studies as well as updates on various projects. This is as much for my benefit as yours and I will store useful things I have learned so I have a place to come back to when I inevitably forget them again.

The first few posts will be getting up to date on some projects, and doing post mortems on some 1 week game prototypes, and generally writing up some of the things I have worked on over the past month or two.
